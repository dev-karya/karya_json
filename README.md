A high-performance, focused JSON serialization and deserialization library for Rust. Designed as a faster alternative to Serde when working specifically with JSON.

## Why Karya JSON?

While Serde is an excellent and versatile serialization framework that supports many formats, Karya JSON focuses exclusively on JSON processing with these advantages:

- **Speed-focused**: Built from the ground up for optimal JSON performance
- **Lightweight**: Smaller footprint with fewer dependencies
- **Simple API**: Streamlined interface designed specifically for JSON
- **Lower compile times**: Reduced macro complexity means faster builds
